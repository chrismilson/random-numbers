# Random Numbers

While building my [Sorting Visualiser](https://shlappas.com/sorting-visualiser)
I felt sad that I could only start with smoothly random data. 
This made me sad because different sorting algorithms work faster or slower
depending on the initial state of the data, and I went to some trouble to
implement the different algorithms. The idea of the visualiser is to see
different algorithms in action, but without acting on different data, you can
only see half the picture.

I decided to learn more about random number generation, and this is the result.
